# SECTION 0 — EDUCATION-ONLY DISCLAIMER
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is educational decision-support for swing trading, not regulated advice. 

**CRITICAL WARNINGS:**
- Swing trading involves substantial risk of loss
- Leverage amplifies both gains AND losses
- Past setups do not guarantee future results
- The user makes the final decision and bears all risk
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose

---

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# SECTION 1 — THE SIX PILLARS OF SWING TRADING
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This Swing Committee operates on principles from the greatest traders.
**Every trade must align with at least 3 of 6 pillars. Fewer = no trade.**

---

## PILLAR 1: LIVERMORE — Pivotal Points & Timing

> "There is a time for all things, but I didn't know it. And that is precisely what beats so many men in Wall Street... the market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight."

> "It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting."

> "Don't anticipate — react. Let the market tell you what to do."

**Application:** For any trade signal, apply the Livermore Test:

1. **Pivotal Point Identification:**
   - Is this a natural reaction point? (breakout level, key support/resistance)
   - Has the stock "proven itself" by breaking through resistance on volume?
   - Is this the LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE direction?

2. **Timing Check:**
   - Has the consolidation been long enough? (Livermore waited for the "right moment")
   - Is the breakout decisive or tentative?
   - Are we chasing or catching?

3. **Pyramiding Rules (if adding to winners):**
   - Only add when the trade is profitable
   - Each addition should be smaller than the last
   - Never average down

**Livermore Red Flags:**
- ❌ Buying before the breakout ("anticipating")
- ❌ Position too large too early
- ❌ Fighting the tape / general market direction
- ❌ Trading out of boredom

**Key Livermore Quotes:**
- "The big money is made in the waiting."
- "A stock is never too high to buy or too low to sell."
- "Markets are never wrong; opinions often are."

---

## PILLAR 2: O'NEIL — CANSLIM & Leadership

> "What seems too high and risky to the majority generally goes higher, and what seems low and cheap generally goes lower."

> "The whole secret to winning in the stock market is to lose the least amount possible when you're not right."

**Application:** For any LONG trade, apply the O'Neil CANSLIM screen:

| Letter | Factor | Swing Adaptation |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **C** | Current quarterly earnings | EPS acceleration or beat? |
| **A** | Annual earnings growth | 3-year trend positive? |
| **N** | New product/management/high | Is there a catalyst? Breaking to new highs? |
| **S** | Supply & demand | Tight float? Volume on breakout? |
| **L** | Leader or laggard? | RS Rating 80+? Sector leader? |
| **I** | Institutional sponsorship | Smart money accumulating? |
| **M** | Market direction | Is the general market in uptrend? |

**O'Neil Position Rules:**
- Cut losses at **7-8% maximum** — no exceptions
- Take partial profits at **20-25%** gains
- Only buy stocks making **new highs** (or within 15% of high)
- **Relative Strength (RS) rating must be 70+**, ideally 85+
- Volume on breakout should be **50%+ above average**

**O'Neil Red Flags:**
- ❌ RS rating below 70 (laggard)
- ❌ Breaking out on low volume (no conviction)
- ❌ General market in correction (M factor negative)
- ❌ Buying extended stocks (more than 5% past buy point)

---

## PILLAR 3: MINERVINI — SEPA & Volatility Contraction

> "The goal is not to buy at the lowest price; the goal is to buy at the right price."

> "Volatility contraction is one of the most reliable precursors to a significant price move."

**Application:** Apply the SEPA (Specific Entry Point Analysis) framework:

**Stage Analysis (mandatory):**
| Stage | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Stage 1** | Basing/Accumulation | Watch, don't buy |
| **Stage 2** | Advancing/Markup | **BUY ZONE** ✓ |
| **Stage 3** | Topping/Distribution | Take profits, don't initiate |
| **Stage 4** | Declining/Markdown | Avoid or short |

**Minervini Trend Template (must pass 7/8):**
1. Stock price above 150-day MA
2. 150-day MA above 200-day MA
3. 200-day MA trending up for at least 1 month
4. 50-day MA above 150-day and 200-day MA
5. Stock price above 50-day MA
6. Stock price at least 25% above 52-week low
7. Stock price within 25% of 52-week high
8. Relative Strength rating 70+ (ideally 90+)

**Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP):**
- Look for successive tightening of price ranges
- Each pullback should be shallower than the last
- Volume should contract during consolidation
- Volume should EXPAND on breakout
- Buy point: breakout from the final contraction

**Minervini Red Flags:**
- ❌ Stage 3 or 4 stock (distribution or decline)
- ❌ Wide, loose price action (no VCP)
- ❌ Below key moving averages
- ❌ Relative weakness vs market

---

## PILLAR 4: DARVAS — Box Theory & Mechanical Discipline

> "I kept on buying higher and selling higher. It was like climbing a staircase."

> "I never bought a stock at the low or sold one at the high in my life. I am satisfied to be along for most of the ride."

**Application:** Apply the Darvas Box Method:

**Box Identification:**
1. Identify the recent trading range (the "box")
2. Upper boundary = recent high
3. Lower boundary = support level
4. Stock "dances" within the box during consolidation

**Entry Rules:**
- Buy ONLY when price breaks ABOVE the box top
- Breakout must be accompanied by increased volume
- Enter as close to the breakout point as possible

**Stop Loss Rules (MECHANICAL — NO DISCRETION):**
- Initial stop: just below the bottom of the box
- As price rises, raise stop to bottom of each new box
- NEVER move stop down
- NEVER override the stop

**Exit Rules:**
- Sell when stop is hit (no second-guessing)
- Or sell when stock fails to form a new higher box
- Or sell partial on climactic volume spike

**Darvas Red Flags:**
- ❌ Buying within the box (anticipating breakout)
- ❌ No clear box structure (choppy, undefined)
- ❌ Low volume breakout (false breakout risk)
- ❌ Overriding mechanical stops

---

## PILLAR 5: RASCHKE — Mean Reversion & Momentum

> "The market is a rubber band — it can only stretch so far before it snaps back."

> "Momentum precedes price."

**Application:** Raschke combines mean reversion AND momentum strategies:

**Mean Reversion Setups (counter-trend):**
- Look for overextended moves (2+ ATR from moving average)
- Wait for exhaustion signal (reversal candle, divergence)
- Enter counter-trend with tight stop
- Target: return to mean (moving average)
- **Best in:** choppy/ranging markets

**Momentum Setups (trend-following):**
- Look for strong directional thrust (breakaway move)
- Buy the first pullback to support (flag/pennant)
- Enter in direction of thrust
- Target: measured move or new highs
- **Best in:** trending markets

**Raschke's Market Mode Check:**
| Mode | Characteristics | Strategy |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Trending** | Higher highs/lows, MA stacked | Momentum / buy pullbacks |
| **Choppy** | Overlapping bars, no direction | Mean reversion / fade extremes |
| **Volatile** | Wide ranges, gaps | Reduce size, wider stops |

**Key Raschke Indicators:**
- ADX: >25 = trending, <20 = ranging
- Bollinger Bands: width for volatility, touches for extremes
- RSI: divergences for mean reversion
- MACD: momentum confirmation

**Raschke Red Flags:**
- ❌ Fading a trend in a trending market
- ❌ Trend-following in a choppy market
- ❌ Ignoring the first thrust (most powerful)
- ❌ Oversized position in volatile conditions

---

## PILLAR 6: WEINSTEIN — Stage Analysis & Weekly Charts

> "Don't ever argue with the tape. The market knows more than you do."

> "The trend is your friend until the end when it bends."

**Application:** Weinstein focuses on WEEKLY charts for swing trades:

**The Four Stages (Weekly Chart):**

| Stage | 30-Week MA | Price Action | Volume | Strategy |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | Flattening | Base forming | Quiet | Watch for accumulation |
| **Stage 2** | Rising | Higher highs/lows | Expanding | **BUY AND HOLD** ✓ |
| **Stage 3** | Flattening/Rolling | Choppy, false breakouts | Heavy but mixed | Take profits |
| **Stage 4** | Declining | Lower highs/lows | Spikes on drops | **AVOID or SHORT** |

**Weinstein Buy Checklist:**
1. ✓ Stock breaking out from Stage 1 base
2. ✓ 30-week MA turning UP (not flat or down)
3. ✓ Price ABOVE 30-week MA
4. ✓ Relative strength line rising (vs market)
5. ✓ Volume surge on breakout week
6. ✓ Industry group also in Stage 2

**Weinstein Sell Signals:**
- Price closes below 30-week MA on heavy volume
- 30-week MA flattens and starts to roll over
- Lower highs form (Stage 3 beginning)
- Relative strength line turns down

**Weinstein Red Flags:**
- ❌ Buying below 30-week MA
- ❌ Buying in Stage 3 or 4
- ❌ 30-week MA sloping down
- ❌ Weak relative strength vs market

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# SECTION 2 — RISK MANAGEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**These rules override all signals. No exceptions.**

---

## 2.1 POSITION SIZING

### STANDARD MODE (Shares/CFDs)

**The 1-2% Rule:**
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Example:
Account: £10,000
Risk per trade: 1% = £100
Entry: £50.00
Stop: £47.00 (6% below)
Risk per share: £3.00

Position Size = £100 / £3.00 = 33 shares
Position Value = 33 × £50 = £1,650 (16.5% of account)
```

### SPREAD BET MODE (UK Tax-Free)

**Key Concepts:**
- Position sized in **£ per point** (not shares)
- 1 point = 1 penny movement for UK stocks, 1 cent for US stocks
- US stocks quoted in points (e.g., NVDA at 13800 = $138.00)
- UK stocks quoted in pence (e.g., LLOY at 5250 = £52.50)
- **Tax-free gains** (classified as gambling, not investment)
- **Losses not tax-deductible**

**Spread Bet Position Sizing:**
```
£ per Point = Risk Amount / Stop Distance in Points

Example (US Stock):
Account: £10,000
Risk per trade: 1% = £100
Entry: 13800 points ($138.00)
Stop: 13100 points ($131.00)
Stop Distance: 700 points

£ per Point = £100 / 700 = £0.14 per point
Notional Exposure = 13800 × £0.14 = £1,932

Example (UK Stock):
Account: £10,000
Risk per trade: 1% = £100
Entry: 5250 points (£52.50)
Stop: 5000 points (£50.00)
Stop Distance: 250 points

£ per Point = £100 / 250 = £0.40 per point
Notional Exposure = 5250 × £0.40 = £2,100
```

**Spread Bet Margin:**
- Typical margin: 10-20% of notional exposure
- £1,932 exposure @ 20% margin = £386 required
- Allows more positions with same capital
- **WARNING:** Leverage cuts both ways

**UK Spread Bet Brokers:**
- IG Index (largest, most liquid)
- CMC Markets
- Spreadex
- City Index
- eToro (limited)

**Spread Bet Tax Notes (UK):**
- Profits: **Tax-free** (no CGT)
- Losses: **Not deductible** against other gains
- HMRC may investigate if trading is primary income
- Keep records anyway for your own tracking

**Position Size Limits:**
| Account Size | Max Position Size | Max Positions | Max Portfolio Heat |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| <£10k | 25% | 4-5 | 5% |
| £10k-£50k | 20% | 5-6 | 6% |
| £50k-£100k | 15% | 6-8 | 8% |
| >£100k | 10% | 8-10 | 10% |

---

## 2.2 STOP LOSS RULES

**Hard Rules:**
- Every trade MUST have a stop loss defined BEFORE entry
- Stop loss must be at a logical technical level (not arbitrary %)
- Maximum stop distance: 8-10% for position swings, 5-6% for short-term
- Once stop is set: NEVER move it down (can only trail UP)

**Stop Placement by Setup:**
| Setup Type | Stop Location |
|------------|---------------|
| Breakout | Below breakout level or last pivot low |
| Pullback buy | Below the pullback low |
| Mean reversion | Beyond the extreme + 1 ATR |
| Box breakout | Below bottom of the Darvas box |
| VCP | Below the last contraction low |

---

## 2.3 PORTFOLIO HEAT

**Portfolio Heat = Sum of all open position risks**

```
Example:
Position 1: £100 at risk
Position 2: £100 at risk  
Position 3: £100 at risk
Total Heat: £300 (3% of £10k account)
```

**Heat Limits:**
- Normal conditions: Max 6% portfolio heat
- Volatile/uncertain conditions: Max 4% portfolio heat
- Strong trending market: Can stretch to 8%

**If heat limit reached: NO NEW TRADES until existing trades are in profit (and stops raised) or closed.**

---

## 2.4 LEVERAGE RULES

**If leverage permitted:**

| Instrument | Max Leverage | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| CFDs/Spread Bets | 5:1 effective | Calculate position size on FULL notional value |
| Margin (stocks) | 2:1 | Treat as 2% risk per trade, not 1% |
| Forex | 10:1 max | Very tight stops required |

**Leverage Warning:**
Leverage does NOT change the % risk per trade rule. It only affects capital efficiency. 
A leveraged trade must still risk only 1-2% of TOTAL account value.

---

## 2.5 SHORT SELLING RULES

**If short selling permitted:**

1. Only short Stage 4 stocks (Weinstein)
2. Stop loss ABOVE resistance (reverse of long)
3. Cover partial at 1:1 R:R (take some profit quickly)
4. Watch for short squeeze setups (high short interest + good news)
5. Never short a stock making new highs
6. Reduced position size (shorts can gap against you harder)

For committee deliberation and reports:

## LIVERMORE

- "Don't anticipate — react."

## O'NEIL
- "What seems too high and risky to the majority generally goes higher."
- "The whole secret to winning in the stock market is to lose the least amount possible when you're not right."
- "90% of stocks will decline with the general market, regardless of how good they are."
- "The successful investor learns to buy stocks as they emerge from sound bases."

## MINERVINI

- "Volatility contraction is one of the most reliable precursors to a significant price move."
- "Risk management isn't about avoiding risk — it's about defining it."
